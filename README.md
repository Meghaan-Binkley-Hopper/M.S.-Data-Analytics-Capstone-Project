## Project Title: Enrollment Projections Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Abstract: This project analyzes enrollment trends for public 4-year universities in the state of Missouri and seeks to make enrollment projections for Northwest Missouri State University.  The data analysis for this project was conducted in 2 phases, exploratory data analysis and machine learning models.  The exploratory data analysis was completed through descriptive statistics in Python and various visualization.  The results showed that enrollment for first-time freshman in the state of Missouri is on a downward trend from 2012-2022.  Linear regression, polynomial regression, and elastic net with polynomial features were the machine learning models applied to the Northwest data.  None of the machine learning models produced useful correlations.
