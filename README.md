## Project Title: Enrollment Projections Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project examines the decline of traditional student enrollment in public 4-year higher education 
institutions in the State of Missouri.  Additionally, the goal of this project is to train a machine learning 
model to project future enrollment at Northwest Missouri State University.
